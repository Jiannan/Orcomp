# Orcomp

The Orcomp library is used to support competitions on the Operations Research Competition blog (http://orcomps.blogspot.com.au/) as well as provide a structured playground for experimenting with new
algorithms and data structures.

Competitions are held at regular intervals. Please check the blog for the latest competitions.

If you can improve an algorithm on any of the past competitions there is always $100 US up for grabs! (Even if the competition is officially over.)
Your solution has to either be an order of magnitude faster than the current winner or a lot shorter and easier to understand. Please use the contact page on the blog to get in contact with us.

Pre canned unit tests for certain interfaces will be made available making it easy for you to check your implementation against these tests. 

Standard performance benchmarks are coming soon as well.

It is our hope that this library will be useful as both a teaching and learning tool for students as well as experienced developers.
