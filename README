# Orcomp

The Orcomp library is used to support competitions on the Operations Research Competition blog (http://orcomps.blogspot.com.au/)

Competitions are held at regular intervals. Please check the blog for the latest competitions.

If you can improve an algorithm on any of the past competitions there is always $100 US up for grabs! (Even if the competition is officially over.)
Your solution has to either be an order of magnitude faster than the current winner or a lot shorter and easier to understand. Please use the contact page on the blog to get in contact with us.
